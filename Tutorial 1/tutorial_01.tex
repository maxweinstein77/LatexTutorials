    To have a hard break where it starts a new paragraph,
    put a line of space between two lines of code.

    To have a soft break where it starts on next line,
    put two \\ at end of previous line of code.

    To have line of space between paragraphs, put \\ at previous line of code 
    and put a line of space between the two lines of code.

    Math mode: put equations in $$

    To ensure equation stays on same line, put enclose the equation in {} before the $$.

    Displayed math mode: every equation on its own line. To do so, use $$. To end it,
    go back to $.
